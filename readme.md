Catalog Generator
=================

A multi-format tool to generate and maintain agency.gov/data catalog files.

## What Problem This Solves

Creating and updating agency.gov/data catalog files is a non-trivial and potentially time-consuming task.

## How This Solves It

Catalog Generator creates conformant catalog files using simple, list-based input.

## Importing and Exporting

Catalog Generator can import both CSV and JSON files, and can export as JSON, HTML (RDFa), and XML

## Under the Hood

Catalog Generator is build using Jekyll, Backbone and CoffeeScript.

There is a collection of `Dataset` models stored as `Application.datasets`. The schema is parsed via YML and stored at `Applciation.schema` as a colleciton of `Field` models. Each Dataset has multiple Fields.

## Requirements

### Using

Catalog Generator runs entirely in your browser. No installation necessary. Simply visit http://project-open-data.github.com/catalog-generator

### Contributing

* Node
* Ruby (Bundler)
* Jekyll
* Grunt
